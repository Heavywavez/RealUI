Adjust icon border color "Special" option to use the bar color swatches for generic buffs and debuffs. This matches the way the "Debuffs" option worked prior to being updated to include buffs and renamed to "Special".
Update list of spells players use to dispel debuffs.
Add a built-in spell effect that generates a 10-second cooldown called Rune Power whenever Rune of Power is successfully cast.

Add option to include/exclude power type buffs (on buffs tab).
Remove option to "show only tracking" since it doesn't interact well with the power bonus bars and can be done with the filter options instead.
Add condition checking for insanity and maelstrom power.
Rework bonus power bars for legion (adds astral power, fury, pain, arcane charges; restricts to appropriate specializations, updates to use legion spells).
Fix icon bug for cooldowns that are on flyouts in the spell book (e.g., grimoire spells).
Update descriptions of bar groups on Setup tab to be more clear which spells pertain to the player versus target/focus.
